# Simple Linear Regression: Predicting Salary Based on Experience

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** model built using Python to predict an employee's **salary** based on their **years of experience**.  

The dataset was already clean, so minimal preprocessing was required. The focus was on understanding the relationship between the two variables and applying a regression model to predict outcomes.

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Since the dataset was clean, only **basic EDA** was performed.
- Plotted graphs:
  - **Years of Experience vs Salary** (actual data distribution)
  - **Years of Experience vs Predicted Salary** (regression line fit)

---

## 🤖 Model
- A **Simple Linear Regression** model was trained.
- The model takes **Years of Experience** as input and predicts the corresponding **Salary**.

---

## 🔮 Prediction
At the end of the notebook/script, you can **input your own years of experience**, and the model will predict the estimated salary.
